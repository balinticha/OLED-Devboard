## 10/28/2025 1 AM - Picked out the components  

I spent quite some time looking at available components, these are my choices:

**Chip:** [The RP2040](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/RaspberryPi-RP2040/C2040), of course. It has awesome C support (which is one of my goals with this project) and a huge resource base.
**Screen**: [HS20S010B](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/HS-HS20S010B/C5329586), a comfortable 320x240 colored LCD.
**Connector:** [TYPE-C-31-M-12](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Korean_HropartsElec-TYPE_C_31_M12/C165948). Unfortunately, this is in the extended library, but for life they don't have a type C connector in basic. This is paired with a [SRV05-4-P-T7 surge protector](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/ProTekDevices-SRV05_4_PT7/C85364).
**LDO**: [AMS1117-3.3](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Advanced_MonolithicSystems-AMS1117_33/C6186). A bit concerned about the thermals, but I'll give it a wide copper pour, and it should be fine.
**Flash**: [W25Q16JVSSIQ](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/WinbondElec-W25Q16JVSSIQ/C131025), the same one used in the RPI Pico.
**Crystal:** [TAXM12M4RLBDDT2T](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Yajingxin-TAXM12M4RLBDDT2T/C133334)
**Buttons:** [TS-1088-AR02016](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/XUNPU-TS_1088AR02016/C720477)

I also spent a good hour staring at the official rp 2040 example board's PCB design.

Oh, and I pre-purchased the screen just in case, as I watched it's stock go down from 240 to 40.

## 10/28/2025 11 AM - First version of the schematic complete

It's a bit messy, but it should work. I might change the GPIO pin layouts later depending on their actual physical location on the 2040, and the files are due for a visual cleanup, but that's something to worry about later.
